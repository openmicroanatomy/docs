==== Creating workspaces, courses and lessons

Create new workspaces by pressing btn:[Create ...] and selecting either `Workspace`, `Course` or `Lesson`. `Course` and `Lesson` are disabled until you select a `Workspace`.

*Delete or rename* any `Workspace`, `Lesson` or `Class` by right-clicking on it. You can also *hide* `Classs`  or set a *description*. Hiding a Class will hide that Class from any guests or users without write permissions. Deleting a `Workspace` will delete all `Lessons` and `Classes` belonging to that `Workspace` and similarly deleting a `Lesson` will delete all `Classes` belonging to that `Lesson`.

==== Adding slides to a lesson

To add a new slide click on btn:[Add images] (next to btn:[Open lesson], see <<img-create-lesson>> above) to open the *Slide manager* interface. From here, select any slide you wish to add and click on btn:[Add selected]. This will open the *QuPath Image Import* interface. These settings are important if you're planning on doing any analysis on the slides later. The default options and setting the *Image type* to *Brightfield (H-DAB)* is usually enough for teaching purposes. Clicking on btn:[Import] will add the slide to the lesson.

==== Making changes to slides

Adding annotations, modifying slide description or such work identically as in QuPath, just make sure you have *enabled editing mode* (see <<img-toolbar>>). Read the https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/starting/annotating.html[QuPath documentation] for detailed information on annotating and such. 

Any changes will be saved when either *a)* clicking on menu:File[Save] or menu:File[Save as], *b)* changing slides, *c)* closing the lesson.

==== Modify Lesson Information

Edit the *Lesson Information* by either *a)* double-click anywhere on the *Lesson Information* tab *b)* menu:File[Project... > Edit lesson information].

Lesson Information supports *rich text*, which includes custom fonts, colors, tables, images, videos, hyperlinks and much more.
