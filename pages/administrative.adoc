Most administrative tools are available by selecting menu:QuPath Edu[...] from the QuPath top bar. Some administrative tasks requires access to the server and are detailed in the <<Open Microanatomy Server>> chapter.

==== Users & Roles

Manage users by opening the *User management* interface using menu:QuPath Edu[Manage users].

Only users with the *Administrative tasks* role are able to migrate users to a different organization.

==== Slides

Manage slides by opening the *Slide management* interface using menu:QuPath Edu[Manage slides].

.Slide management interface. Each slide has an UUID _(Universal Unique Identifier)_ which distinguishes it from others.

Users with the *Administrative tasks* roles are able to view & modify all slides regardless of organization. Users with only the *Manage slides* roles can only view & modify slides that belong to the users organization.

*Import new slides* by clicking the btn:[Import slide] button. QuPath verifies that the selected slide is compatible with QuPath Edu and starts uploading it. After upload the Open Microanatomy Server processes the slide which can take up to 30 minutes depending on the slide size and server performance.

*Deleting* a slide will make it inaccessible from any Lesson that contains it but *will not* remove it from the slide listing. Deleted slides must be removed manually from each lesson also. *Renaming* a slide will only affect slides added in the future.

WARNING: In Open Microanatomy Server *version 1.0* deleting slides only makes them inaccessible but *does not* remove the data stored. It is up to the server administrator to delete any associated data.

You can view any slide by clicking on btn:[Open selected]. If you have a lesson open, you will be prompted to add that slide to the current project.

==== Backups

Manage *lesson* backups by opening the *Backup management* interface using menu:QuPath Edu[Manage backups].

Restore a lesson by selecting the lesson and pressing btn:[Restore backup] or preview it first by pressing btn:[Preview backup]. Backups are automatically deleted after 30 days. 

WARNING: Currently there's no way to restore a deleted workspace / class or a lesson without administrative tools. A whole database backup is performed every 24 hours, which can be used to restore any deleted workspace / class or lesson.

NOTE: In QuPath Edu Server version 1.0 a bug exists, which allows users with write permissions to preview all backups regardless of organization. Restoring backups is still limited to users with proper write permissions to a specific workspace.

*Making any changes to an organization requires the _Administrative tasks_ role*.

*Deleting* an organization will delete *permanently all data* associated with that project, including *workspaces, lessons, courses, users, and slides*.

Clicking btn:[Edit] allows you to *rename* and *upload a logo* for that organization, see <<img-edit-organization>>.

==== Permissions

Manage permissions by opening the *Permission management* interface using menu:QuPath Edu[Manage permissions].

By default, when creating a new workspace, it is automatically assigned the *Write* access for *yourself* and *Read* access to *no-one*. You can restrict access to either *a)* only yourself, *b)* specific organizations, *c)* specific users, *d)* combination of users and organizations. 

Simply use btn:[&rsaquo;], btn:[&raquo;]btn:[&lsaquo;] and btn:[&laquo;] to add/remove permissions. Double-arrows moves *all items* and single-arrows move *only the selected item*. Clicking btn:[?] will give you an analysis of who has read/write permissions in plain English.

Remember to press btn:[Save changes] _(bottom right-hand corner)_; currently QuPath Edu gives *no warning* if forgetting to save any changes.

.Permission management interface. *1:* List of all workspaces, the organization is specified in parentheses. *2 & 3:* Read & write permissions separated in different tabs. *4 & 5:* Left pane indicates any users/organizations available and right pane indicates users/organizations with active permissions.
