==== First time setup

When starting QuPath Edu for the first time, you'll see the _First-time setup_ dialog. You must either select a _public host_ or enter your *QuPath Edu Servers* address to continue. If you are unsure what your institutions address is, try contacting your IT-services. Public hosts are QuPath Edu Servers which can be freely viewed by anyone. Currently the only public host is the demo server provided by the University of Oulu.

You can change your host later by clicking the *Change host ...* link on the *Login dialog* (see xref:img-login[xrefstyle=short]) or from the QuPath settings menu:Edit[Preferences > Edu]

==== Logging in

You can continue either *Continue as a guest* _(only read permissions)_ or authenticate using *Credentials* _(regular email & password combination)_ or a *Microsoft account*.

NOTE: Logging in using Credentials and/or Microsoft Authentication may not be available on your organization depending on your _Open Microanatomy Server_ setup.

.Login dialog. Change host by pressing the btn:[Change host ...] on the bottom-right hand corner.
