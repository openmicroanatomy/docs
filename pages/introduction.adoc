=== What is QuPath Edu

QuPath Edu is a project which contains three components: *QuPath Edu Extension*, *QuPath Edu Server* and *QuPath Edu Cloud _(to be renamed)_*.

https://github.com/yli-hallila/qupath-edu-extension[*QuPath Edu Extension*] is an extension for https://qupath.github.io/[QuPath], which allows QuPath to communicate with a https://github.com/yli-hallila/qupath-edu-server[*QuPath Edu Server*], thus making it possible to view, edit and modify QuPath projects (called _Lessons_ in QuPath Edu). The *QuPath Edu Server* handles all the heavy lifting required to authenticate users, upload & delete new slides, manage data and so on. _QuPath Edu_ is also compatible with other data sources, such as https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-omero[Omero]. 

QuPath Edu also includes https://github.com/yli-hallila/qupath-edu-cloud[*QuPath Edu Cloud* _(to be renamed)_], which is a web application that communicates with a *QuPath Edu Server* and can be used for *viewing* projects.

=== Hierarchy

A *QuPath Edu Server* is _“compartmentalized”_ as shown in *Figure 2.* Each server can host one or multiple _Organizations_. Each organization has its own _Workspaces_, which hold _Classes_, which contain the _Lessons_. See *Table 1* for how to think about these.
