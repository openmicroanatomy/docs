=== What is OpenMicroanatomy

OpenMicroanatomy is a project built on top of QuPath which contains three components: *OpenMicroanatomy Server*, *OpenMicroanatomy Web* and *QuPath Edu Extension*.

https://github.com/openmicroanatomy/qupath-extension[*QuPath Edu Extension*] is an extension for https://qupath.github.io/[QuPath], which allows QuPath projects (called _Lessons_ in QuPath Edu) to be synced between multiple users via an https://github.com/openmicroanatomy/server[*OpenMicroanatomy Server*]. The *OpenMicroanatomy Server* handles all the heavy lifting required to authenticate users, upload new slides, manage data and so on. _QuPath Edu_ is also compatible with other data sources, such as https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-omero[Omero].

OpenMicroanatomy also includes https://github.com/openmicroanatomy/web[*OpenMicroanatomy Web*], which is a web application that communicates with a *OpenMicroanatomy Server* and can be used for *viewing* projects.

=== Hierarchy

A *OpenMicroanatomy Server* is _“compartmentalized”_ as shown in *Figure 2.* Each server can host one or multiple _Organizations_. Each organization has its own _Workspaces_, which hold _Classes_, which contain the _Lessons_. See *Table 1* for how to think about these.
